## ✅ Conclusion

There is always room for improvement in any application. Currently, XOXA focuses on real-time text messaging between users. While several Android apps offer similar functionality, many of them suffer from complicated interfaces and poor usability.

This project aims to provide a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly chat experience. By focusing on clean design and usability, XOXA emphasizes the importance of a positive first impression in both human relationships and digital communication.
