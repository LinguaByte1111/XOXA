## Introduction

**XOXA** is a real-time messaging application built for Android devices. It allows users to communicate instantly through private and group chats using text messages and emoji sharing over the internet. The project consists of two components: a **Client Application** and a **Server Application**, both running on Android devices.

**XOXA** is designed for high performance and scalability — it can run **100 conversations simultaneously**, providing smooth and reliable real-time communication even under heavy load.

## ✅ Conclusion

There is always room for improvement in any application. Currently, XOXA focuses on real-time text messaging between users. While several Android apps offer similar functionality, many of them suffer from complicated interfaces and poor usability.

This project aims to provide a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly chat experience. By focusing on clean design and usability, XOXA emphasizes the importance of a positive first impression in both human relationships and digital communication.
